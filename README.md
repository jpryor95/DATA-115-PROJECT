# DATA-115-PROJECT
Motivation: I wanted to find out what movies have been nomainted for the Academy Award for both Best Picture and Best Orginal Score as I was also enrolled Film Music this semester.
Data Proccess: I collected my data from the offical Academy Awards database and imported the data I needed into an Excel spreadsheet. I included every film that was nominated for both awards (inclduing Orginal Song as some of the earlier Academy Awards included this award and some years split the award for Orginal Score in two awards for drama and comedy/musical) for the years 1934-2019. For the Excel file, I set it up to contain four colums Movie, Year, Winner?, and Count which was for the amount of awards so the range was 0-2

Analysis: I had to really clean up my intial spreadsheet by changing most of string data to neumeric data.
